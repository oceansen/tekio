  journal = {Transformation},
  year = {2009},
  pages = {1--10},
  abstract = {In Model-Driven SPL approaches, the derivation of a product starts
	from a domain application model. This model is transformed using
	model transformations, which are se- lected according to variants
	included in configurations, un- til a product is obtained. There
	are at least two drawbacks to these approaches. First, the selection
	of variants affects the whole domain application model, impeding
	fine-grained configurations, i.e. configurations at the level of
	each ele- ment in the model, and second, model transformations are
	coupled with variants which make their maintenance and adaptation
	difficult. We present an approach that uses meta- modeling and feature
	modeling. A novelty in our approach is the possibility of configuring
	a product from a domain application model in which elements can be
	bound sepa- rately to features. These fine-grained configurations
	are an input to the derivation process which uses decision models
	and Aspect-Oriented Programming, facilitating the reuse, adaptation
	and composition of model transformations.},
  annote = {Our approach facilitates the binding of model elements to particular
	features, prevents the creation of in- valid bindings and makes possible
	the dynamic adaptation of model transformations without coupling
	them with infor- mation about variability choices. We achieve this
	by using fine-grained configurations, constraint models, and decision
	models which take the set of bindings defining a configura- tion
	to generate different model transformation scheduling. We use Aspect-Oriented
	Programming (AOP) [13, 17] to build the scheduling of the model transformations,
	i.e. the order in which model transformations process model ele-
	ments to accomplish a desired derivation},

  abstract = {Industries that successfully apply product line approaches often operate
	in markets that are well established and have a strategic perspective.
	Consequently, such organizations have a tendency towards long-term
	planning of products and product lines. Although there are numerous
	approaches for efficient product line engineering, there is surprisingly
	little support for a long-term, strategic perspective and an evolu-
	tion of product lines. To address these challenges, we aim to integrate
	evolution into model-driven product line engi- neering. In particular,
	we explore how feature models can be applied to describe the evolution
	of product lines. The paper contributes (i) concepts for describing
	the evolution of product lines with feature models, (ii) a corresponding
	framework, which puts this into a bigger context and (iii) three
	scenarios that show how this framework can be ap- plied. The concepts
	are motivated with examples from au- tomotive software engineering
	and embedded systems, which are industries with a strong affinity
	to product lines, where long term planning of the product portfolio
	are common strategies.},

  abstract = {Product line engineering is an emerging paradigm of devel- oping a
	family of products. While product line analysis and design mainly
	focus on reasoning about commonality and variability of family members,
	product line implementation gives its attention to mechanisms of
	managing variability. In many cases, however, product line methods
	do not impose any specific synthesismechanisms on product line implemen-
	tation, so implementation details are left to developers. In our
	previous work, we adopted feature-oriented product line engineering
	to build a family of compilers and managed vari- ations using the
	Standard ML module system. We demon- strated the applicability of
	this module system to product line implementation. Although we have
	benefited from the product line engineering paradigm, it mostly served
	us as a design paradigm to change the way we think about a set of
	closely related compilers, not to change the way we build them. The
	problem was that Standard ML did not fully realize this paradigm
	at the code level, which caused some difficulties when we were developing
	a set of compilers. In this paper, we address such issues with a
	language- based solution. MLPolyR is our choice of an implemen- tation
	language. It supports three different programming styles. First,
	its first-class cases facilitate composable ex- tensions at the expression
	levels. Second, its module lan- guage provides extensible and parameterizedmodules,
	which make large-scale extensible programming possible. Third, its
	macro system simplifies specification and composition of feature
	related code. We will show how the combination of these language
	features work together to facilitate the prod- uct line engineering
	paradigm.},

	of developing intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs). A novel and advantageous
	solution to this problem is the development of a task-specific ITS
	shell that can generate tutoring systems for different domains within
	a given class of tasks. Task-specific authoring shells offer an appropriate
	knowledge representation method to build knowledgeable tutors as
	well as flexibility for generating ITSs for different domains. In
	this paper, we describe the development of an architecture that can
	generate intelligent tutoring systems for different domains by interfacing
	with existing generic task-based expert systems, and reusing the
	other tutoring components. The architecture was used to generate
	an ITS for the domain of composite materials fabrication using an
	existing expert system.},

  abstract = {Model driven engineering (MDE) of software product lines (SPLs) merges
	two increasing important paradigms that synthesize programs by transformation.
	MDE creates programs by transforming models, and SPLs elaborate programs
	by applying transformations called features. In this paper, we present
	the design and implementation of a transformational model of a product
	line of scalar vector graphics and JavaScript applications. We ex-
	plain how we simplified our implementation by lifting selected features
	and their compositions from our original product line (whose implementations
	were complex) to features and their compositions of another product
	line (whose specifications were simple). We used operators to map
	higher-level features and their compositions to their lower-level
	counterparts. Doing so exposed commuting relationships among feature
	compositions in both prod- uct lines that helped validate our model
	and implementation.},

  title = {{D1.2 Framework for Identifying and Modelling of Dynamic Variability
	in Requirements}},
  institution = {University of Lancaster, UK},
  year = {2010},
  abstract = {In the present document we present the first part of the DiVA RE approach
	which mainly focuses on answering the question on what (requirements,
	their justification and context) to model, as well as touches on
	the issue of how to restrict the proliferation of variants in requirements
	models. To address these questions, the DiVA RE approach proposes
	to: â€¢ construct a feature tree from the input requirements text,
	thus identifying specific requirements that need to be modelled,
	and refining this tree with variations and adaptation points; â€¢
	recover the hard- and soft-goals related to the given requirements
	to provide a justification for them, and also to use a single goal-model
	for modelling the large set of potential variations; â€¢ analyse
	the resultant goal/feature tree to extract the relevant context and
	related variability and constraints which restricts the set of potential
	configurations. In addition, the overall DiVA perspective of core
	and aspect fragments is also applicable to the RE model, treating
	aspects as model fragments that encapsulate variability and can motivate
	run-time change. The present document consists of three core sections:
	first (section 2) briefly outlines the challenges for the RE for
	dynamic systems; section 3, which is the core of this document, presents
	the DiVA RE approach and illustrates it with a brief example taken
	from the CAS customer management system of D6.1; this is followed
	by an overview of how DiVA RE tackles the challenges discussed in
	section 2 (section 4), finally section 5 gives a brief summary of
	work related to the DiVA RE approach; the document is then summarised
	by section 6. The current document also contains 3 appendixes, which
	are papers published on this work and these are referenced from the
	core of the document, where needed, for more detail, thus reducing
	unnecessary duplication of detail in the document itself.},

  abstract = {Designing distributed computing systems is a complex process requiring
	a solid understanding of the design problems and the theoretical
	and practical aspects of their solutions. This comprehensive textbook
	covers the fundamental principles and models underlying the theory,
	algorithms and systems aspects of distributed computing. Broad and
	detailed coverage of the theory is balanced with practical systems-related
	issues such as mutual exclusion, deadlock detection, authentication,
	and failure recovery. Algorithms are carefully selected, lucidly
	presented, and described without complex proofs. Simple explanations
	and illustrations are used to elucidate the algorithms. Important
	emerging topics such as peer-to-peer networks and network security
	are also considered. With state-of-the-art algorithms, numerous illustrations,
	examples and homework problems, this textbook is suitable for advanced
	undergraduate and graduate students of electrical and computer engineering
	and computer science. Practitioners in data networking and sensor
	networks will also find this a valuable resource. Additional resources

	2011. doi: 10.1111/j.1475-1313.2011.00834.x ABSTRACT: Computer vision
	syndrome (CVS) is the combination of eye and vision problems associated
	with the use of computers. In modern western society the use of computers
	for both vocational and avocational activities is almost universal.
	However, CVS may have a significant impact not only on visual comfort
	but also occupational productivity since between 64\% and 90\% of
	computer users experience visual symptoms which may include eyestrain,
	headaches, ocular discomfort, dry eye, diplopia and blurred vision
	either at near or when looking into the distance after prolonged
	computer use. This paper reviews the principal ocular causes for
	this condition, namely oculomotor anomalies and dry eye. Accommodation
	and vergence responses to electronic screens appear to be similar
	to those found when viewing printed materials, whereas the prevalence
	of dry eye symptoms is greater during computer operation. The latter
	is probably due to a decrease in blink rate and blink amplitude,
	as well as increased corneal exposure resulting from the monitor
	frequently being positioned in primary gaze. However, the efficacy
	of proposed treatments to reduce symptoms of CVS is unproven. A better
	understanding of the physiology underlying CVS is critical to allow
	more accurate diagnosis and treatment. This will enable practitioners
	to optimize visual comfort and efficiency during computer operation.},

  title = {{Feature-based component model for design of embedded systems}},
  journal = {Proceedings of SPIE},
  year = {2004},
  pages = {226--237},
  abstract = {An embedded system is a hybrid of hardware and software, which combines
	softwareâ€™s flexibility and hardware real-time performance. Embedded
	systems can be considered as assemblies of hardware and software
	components. An Open Embedded System Model (OESM) is currently being
	developed at NIST to provide a standard representation and exchange
	protocol for embedded systems and system-level design, simulation,
	and testing information. This paper proposes an approach to representing
	an embedded system feature-based model in OESM, i.e., Open Embedded
	System Feature Model (OESFM), addressing models of embedded system
	artifacts, embedded system components, embedded system features,
	and embedded system configuration/assembly. The approach provides
	an object-oriented UML (Unified Modeling Language) representation
	for the embedded system feature model and defines an extension to
	the NIST Core Product Model. The model provides a feature-based component
	framework allowing the designer to develop a virtual embedded system
	prototype through assembling virtual components. The framework not
	only provides a formal precise model of the embedded system prototype
	but also offers the possibility of designing variation of prototypes
	whose members are derived by changing certain virtual components
	with different features. A case study example is discussed to illustrate
	the embedded system model. Keywords: Embedded system, feature-based
	modeling, component-based approach, UML, object-oriented representation},

	depends on how well features Because there is crosscutting among
	the features, it is difficult to implement these variabilities are

	introduced aspect-oriented techniques into SPLs to modularize the
